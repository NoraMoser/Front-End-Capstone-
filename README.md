# Remote Clinical Trial

## This app is designed to help patients participate in clinical trials from the comfort of home.

### There are three parts to this app:
1. The exercise page- patients go here to see how-to demonstrations of the required exercises and time themselves doing them. Patients will write notes at the end about anything they think the researchers should know.
1. The graph page- patients go here to track their progress over time (y axis is seconds and x axis is date)
1. the PDF- when you are finished with everything, download a pdf to send to your researcher so they can check your progress.  Patient notes will show up here.
